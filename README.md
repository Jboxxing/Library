# Library

- Chain of libraries called LibraryA1, LibraryA2, etc.
- The way this simple library application is designed (so far), only one library can be viewed/modified at a time and by only one client/staff member at a time.
- *When staff members and clients use the operations defined in the Operations interface to view or modify a library, they must be registered with that library.
- Staff members and clients can search for books in a library by ID, name, or author.
- Staff members can also add or remove books and ban clients from their associated library (resulting in the client's removal from registration).
- Clients can also checkout and return books (need to define and implement return function).
